        <h1>Usability Test</h1>
            <p>For the usability test i asked the participants to complete 3 tasks.<br></p>
            <p><b>Task 1 :</b> Search for videos on a specified topic</p>
            <p><b>Task 2 :</b> Share a video</p>
            <p><b>Task 3 :</b> Upload a video</p>
        <h2>Participant 1 :</h2>
            <p><b>Task 1 :</b></p>
                <p>Time taken to complete : 20 sec<br>
                    I specifically asked for the user to search for power tools<br>
                    no problems arose<br>
                </p>
            <p><b>Task 2 :</b></p>
                <p>Time taken to complete : 1 min 20 sec<br>
                    clicked on video to share rather then use the share button from<br>
                    the home page<br>
                </p>
            <p><b>Task 3 :</b></p>
                <p>Time taken to complete : 3min 24 sec<br>
                    Once again clicked on video before finding the function<br>
                    Got confused by my chrome add-ons, removed them for next test<br>
                    Got confused by browser function, fullscreened website next test<br>
                    Gave help mentioning it was a single button on the screen and didnt need<br>
                    to be clicked into
                </p>
        <h2>Participant 2 :</h2>
            <p><b>Task 1 :</b></p>
                <p>Time taken to complete : 38 sec<br>
                    Asked user to search for boxing<br>
                    again no problems arose
                </p>
            <p><b>Task 2 :</b></p>
                <p>Time taken to complete : 36 sec<br>
                    again user clicked on video to share rather then use the functioon<br>
                    from home screen
                </p>
            <p><b>Task 3 :</b></p>
                <p>Time taken to complete : 1 min 35 sec<br>
                    gave guidance that user had glanced over the button when the got stuck
                </p>
        <h2>Conclusion :</h2>
            <p>
                The Search function and upload function seem to be understanble to users unfamilar<br>
                with the website. I attribute the time to find the upload function to lack of experince<br>
                One thing i do note is that bothe users clicked on the cideo to share, failing to find the<br>
                share function present on the home page. This is most likely due to the function being behind<br>
                a three dot icon that only appears when hovering over a video<br>
