        <h1>Usability Assement</h1>
            <h2>Flexibility :</h2>
                <img src="H7Positive.png" alt="Positive example of Flexibility">
                <p>Youtube features variuos shortcuts that can be used by advanved users.<br>
                    Users are able to learn of these commands naturally as certain shortcuts will be shown when hovering over the feature the shortcut is for.<br>
                    This allows users who are unaware of these shortcuts to find out about them without being told by someoine else of finding it online.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="H7Negative.png" alt="Negative example of Flexibility">
                <p>However despite showing some shortcuts, theier are still shortcuts, such as frame<br>
                    stepping, that a user cant find out about without searching for it.w
                </p>
            <h2>Aesthetic and minimalist design :</h2>
                <img src="H8Positive.png" alt="Positive example of minimalist design" width="800" height="384.06">
                <p>Youtube is great for only displaying required information. As seen in the pic above,<br>
                    even tho multiple videos are displayed at once, we are only given the info we need on them,<br>
                    that being views, creator, title and how long ago the video was uploaded to the website.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="H8Negative.png" alt="Negative example of minimalist design" width="800" height="384.06">
                <p>There are two pages i could find that don't follow the design of the rest<br>
                    of the website and have less appeal as well as wasted space. These pages are the terms<br>
                    page and the contact us page.
                </p>

            <h2>Recognition rather than recall :</h2>
                <img src="H6Positive.png" alt="Positive example of recognition rather than recall">
                <p>Youtube makes sure its users are well informed of what different icons mean even if they look similar.<br>
                    A good example in the pic is the two icons for 'history' and 'watch later'.<br>
                    Despite these icons being simlar in design, because they are labeled users can identify them without thinking<br>
                </p>
                <img src="H6Negative.png" alt="Negative example of recognition rather than recall">
                <p>The symbols on a videos timeline are for the most part self explanitory.<br>
                    However two symbols, miniplayer and theature player are hard to identify<br>
                    these symbols require the user to hover over them to understand what they do<br>
                    and even then without using the feature users wont know what they do.
                </p>
            <h2>Error prevention :</h2>
                <img src="H5Positive.png" alt="Positive example of Error Display" width="800" height="384.06">
                <p>Youtube is very clear when an error occurs.<br>
                    The pic aboce illustrates how youtube informs the users why an error has occured in very simple language.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="H5Positive.png" alt="Negative example of Error Display" width="800" height="384.06">
                <p>Despite youtube usually explaining their errors clearly youtube still falls victim to<br>
                    errors without explaination as seen above.
                </p>
            <h2>Match between system and the real world :</h2>
                <img src="H2Positive.png" alt="Positive example of Simple language">
                <p>Youtube uses very simple language throughout the website so that the users full understand<br>
                    what is being communicated. This is important for the user to understand without needing external resources.<br>
                    In the pic presented, found in the how does youtube work section, we see that they use simple language to <br>
                    describe youtubes commitments to the commmunity.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="H2Negative.png" alt="Negative example of simple language">
                <p>Despite Youtube featuring simple language throught out the website, even<br>
                    for complicated topics such as copyright, one area of the website where this<br>
                    falters is the terms of service. The terms of service use more comlicated language<br>
                    even though it is expected to be read by everyone making a youtube account.
                </p>
            <h2>Consistency :</h2>
                <img src="H4Positive1.png" alt="Positive example of Consistency"><img src="H4Positive2.png" alt="Positive example of Consistency">
                <img src="H4Positive3.png" alt="Positive example of Consistency"><img src="H4Positive4.png" alt="Positive example of Consistency">
                <p>Youtube has a consistency with other apps that are owned by google. The best examples is for most<br>
                    google apps, The home button for the website is featured in the top left while the users profile is<br>
                    located in the top right. Consistency is important as it allows users to understand new websites easier<br>
                    based on past experience.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="H4Negative.png" alt="Negative example of Consistency">
                <p>A bad example of cinsistency on yotube is in the how youtbe works section.<br>
                    This part of youtbe features the home button at the top left however<br>
                    despite looking the same as the normal home button, this button takes you<br>
                    to the first page of how youtube works. This is in contrast to youtube studio<br>
                    which features a unique home button<br>

                </p>
            <h2>User Help :</h2>
                <img src="H10Positive.png" alt="Positive example of help system">
                <p>Youtubes help system is easy to use and easy to understand. It presents users with<br>
                    frequently asked questions and allows them to search a question. This will provide<br>
                    the user with videos and documents related to their search query.<br>
                </p>
                <img src="H10Negative.png" alt="Negative example of help system">
                <p>One big feature missing from Youtubes help system is the ability to sumbit a ticket.<br>
                    Most services allow a user to send a ticket containing information on their problem to<br>
                    be reviewed. This is a feature missing from Youtube
