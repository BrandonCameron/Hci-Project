        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>As i expected Youtube is a very tightly construted website.<br>
                There were no glaring errors i could find and the few errors i found<br>
                were very minor. These errors as stuff that can easily be improved<br>
                upon which is something that is happening constantly on Youtube.<br>
                I found the website to be mostly accesable. The main problem is that<br>
                you tab through the side tab on the home page before videos but that is<br>
                most likely for the best since youtube videos are constanly loading as you<br>
                scroll. Overall I found the usability of Youtube to be exceptional. The<br>
                website was quiclky picked up on by users with no experience even though <br>
                there is always room for improvement. The website being as big as it<br>
                is and used by so many people means that the people at Youtube would have<br>
                plenty of data which they have used to improve the website and which they<br>
                will use to continue to improve.<br>
                <br>
                Thank you for taking the time to read my rewview of usability and<br>
                accessability for Youtube<br>
